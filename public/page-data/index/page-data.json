With Gatsby.js and Next.js you get an HTML file, but the mechanics differ behind the scenes. However, it's important to be aware of how this will be parsed. In Next.js, when you request something, it goes to Node.js. Node.js pre-renders all the content on the server, and it serves it right down to you as if your browser had rendered itself.
